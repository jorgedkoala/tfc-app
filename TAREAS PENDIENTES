So if you didn’t find it in the folder run the command :
ionic cordova build android
This command will generate an APK in debug mode. But the most important here is the Gradle download.
When this command finishes, the gradlew will be found.
It’s time!
Now that we know where gradlew file is it’s time to generate the.aab file. Honestly I was impressed with the ease of doing this.
In the platforms/android you will run gradlew file with bundle task. The command looks like:
gradlew bundle
./gradlew bundle
